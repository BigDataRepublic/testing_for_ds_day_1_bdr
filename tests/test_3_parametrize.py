# -- Exercise 1* --
# Test the output of def number_of_positions() from hanoi/basics.py, parametrizing over number_of_disks.


# -- Exercise 2 --
# What happens to the test_ids of parametrized tests? (Use ```pytest --collect-only```.)
# Find out what "ids" does, when used in pytest.mark.parametrize(... ids= ...).


# -- Exercise 3 --
# Like exercise 1, write a test for number_of_steps_of_solution(). But now, parametrize all tests in this module at
# the same time.


# -- Exercise 4* --
# Mark all tests in this file with a new mark: "parametrization_paragraph", using only one line of code. Make sure to
# register the mark.
