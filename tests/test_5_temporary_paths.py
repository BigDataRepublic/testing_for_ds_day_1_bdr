# -- Exercise 1 --
# Write a test that checks that the output of the printed graph with 2 disks, is exactly as expected.
# Use the fixture tmp_path.


# -- Exercise 2 --
# Write a test that checks that the combined file size is smaller than 1Kb, for the printed graph for 1, ..., 4 disks.
# Use the fixture tmp_path_factory.


# -- Exercise 3 --
# How is the solution visible in the graph?
# Use that information to write a test, to validate the output of the graph (from 1 to 5 disks).
